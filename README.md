# Meeting suggester

Takes the output of [icaltoday](https://github.com/kljensen/icaltoday)
and returns a set of suggested meetings times. Suggests a small number
of times that are diverse and densely packed based on my own preferences.

Mostly I use this with [espanso](https://espanso.org) in order to quickly
propose meeting times whilst writing email.

This code can be altered for your preferences.
